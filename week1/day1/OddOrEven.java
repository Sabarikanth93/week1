//    5+1 - addition
//   5-1 - subtraction    5*1 - multiplication

//Classroom Assignment 5: 
//Print if the given number is odd or even
//Goal: To understand the mod operator, conditional statement and logic writing
//a) Create a class by name: OddOrEven
//b) Create a main method using shortcut
//c) Declare a class variable of type of int with a value as input
//d) Write a logic to print if the given input is odd or even
//Hint: Divide the given input by 2 and if the remainder is 0 -> even else odd. 
//Use mod (%) operator to find remainder
